# Python Team Chooser

## To start this project you need to first clone this repo, and add your players in the players.txt file. 

First you need to clone the repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/GitAryanCode/python-team-chooser`

Second you need to put your players in the players.txt, you HAVE to put the names line by line or else the program will think it's one whole name.

Third run the file on command prompt, you have to be in the working dir and type `python teams.py`
